# Game of life

This is the implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

Currently it uses two 2d arrays to represent game field.

TO DO:
* Optimize algorithm by adding changing list that holds only alive cells and work through it.
* Optimize algorithm by adding look-up table.
* Allow user to interact with the game: set the initial state of the field; change game speed.
